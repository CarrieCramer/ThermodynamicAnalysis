Thermodynamic Analysis Software: 

MATLAB program that reads in pressure and specific volume values from a data file, formats the data, performs unit conversions, and plots pressure vs. specific volume and pressure vs. temperature for H2O (including critical points). 

It also prompts the user to enter a specific volume value and analyzes the corresponding pressures. 

The software then plots the pressure values from the data file vs. the user-entered specific volume and prints how many of the corresponding pressure values are saturated, two-phase, and superheated. 

The software also linearly interpolates several properties of the pressures from the data file and writes the results to a new data file.

This program was designed for an assignment for the Boston University course ENG EK 127 (Spring 2013, Professor Attaway).
